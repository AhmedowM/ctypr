# ctypr Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

ctypr is a **C rewrite** of the C++ typing practice library [typr-cpp](https://github.com/your-username/typr-cpp). The C++ version is fully featured with content providers, SQLite persistence, chunking, logging, 62 test cases, and a complete CMake build system. This C port is in early stages — core engine logic exists but most features are not yet implemented.

**Reference C++ project location:** `C:\Users\Secondary\Projects\typr-cpp`

## Fixed Bugs

The following 10 bugs were identified and fixed in the initial bug-fix pass:

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | Backspace logic inversion — `correctKeystrokes` decremented for incorrect chars | Changed condition: only decrement `correctKeystrokes` when the backspaced character was correct; reset flag for incorrect ones |
| 2 | `totalKeystrokes` incremented on backspace | Removed `self->stats.totalKeystrokes++` from `engineBackspacePress_Flow` |
| 3 | `clock()` used instead of wall-clock time | Replaced with `QueryPerformanceCounter` (Windows) / `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` (POSIX) |
| 4 | Accumulated time truncated to whole seconds | Changed to `int64_t accumulatedTimeMs` — stores milliseconds with no truncation |
| 5 | Sentinel value `0` conflicted with valid `clock()` return | Added `bool isTimingStarted` flag instead of checking `segmentStartTime == 0` |
| 6 | `ENGINE_EVENT_FINISHED` never fired on completion | Added `engineExecuteCallbacks(self, &(EngineEvent){ENGINE_EVENT_FINISHED})` in both strict and flow modes |
| 7 | `void*` event parameter in callbacks (type-unsafe) | Changed to `EngineEvent*` in `callback.h` and `engine.c`; moved `EngineCallback` typedef to `event.h` to resolve circular dependency |
| 8 | `ENGINE_EVENT_STOPPED` never fired on completion | Added `engineExecuteCallbacks(self, &(EngineEvent){ENGINE_EVENT_STOPPED})` alongside finish event |
| 9 | `strcpy` without bounds checking | Replaced with `snprintf(self->session->text, sizeof(self->session->text), ...)` |
| 10 | `totalKeystrokes` and `currentIndex` coupled in Flow mode | Moved `totalKeystrokes++` to before the correct/incorrect branch so it's always incremented once per keypress, independent of `currentIndex++` |

## Code Improvements

### 1. Build system activation ✅ Completed

### 2. Missing test suite ✅ Completed

### 3. Empty feature directories ✅ Completed

### 4. `ENGINE_EVENT_STARTED` callback never fired ✅ Completed

### 5. Engine struct defined in .c file prevents user stack allocation

**Location:** `src/core/engine.c`, line 45-60

**Problem:** The `Engine` struct is defined in the `.c` file, making it opaque to users. This is fine for encapsulation but prevents stack allocation and forces all users to use `engineCreate`/heap allocation. The C++ version uses Pimpl for the same effect.

**Improvement:** Consider exposing the struct definition (or a forward-compatible version) in the header so users can optionally stack-allocate engines for performance-sensitive applications.

### 6. Missing timeout implementation ✅ Completed

**Location:** `src/core/engine.c`

**Problem:** The engine has a `timeout` field that can be set and retrieved, but the timeout was never checked during execution. Sessions would never automatically stop due to timeout.

**Solution:** Added `checkTimeout()` called at the start of `engineKeyPress_Strict`, `engineKeyPress_Flow`, and `engineBackspacePress_Flow`. Emits `ENGINE_EVENT_TIMEOUT` and transitions to `ENGINE_STOP_CAUSE_TIMEOUT`. Paused time is excluded from accumulation.

### 7. No incorrect keystrokes counter in SessionStats

**Location:** `src/core/stats.h`

**Problem:** `SessionStats` has `correctKeystrokes` and `totalKeystrokes` but no explicit `incorrectKeystrokes` counter. Accuracy is calculated from these two values. With the backspace bugs, this can produce accuracy > 100% or other corrupt values. The C++ version's `Stats` struct also derives incorrect from total - correct, but handles it more carefully.

**Improvement:** Add an explicit `incorrectKeystrokes` field to `SessionStats` to simplify calculations and provide a single source of truth independent of potential counter corruption.

### 8. Missing `#include "event.h"` in callback.h ✅ Completed

### 9. NULL-pointer safety inconsistencies ⚠️ Partial progress

**Location:** Various functions in `engine.c`

**Problem:** Some functions check for NULL `self`, some don't. The pattern is inconsistent.

**Improvement:** Signal registration functions added in the refactor all check for NULL `engine`. The lifecycle and state query functions already check. A full audit of all 50+ functions is still pending.

### 10. Use of `strcpy`, `sprintf`, and raw buffers

**Improvement:** Replace `strcpy` with `snprintf` or `strncpy` throughout. Consider using dynamic string allocation or safer buffer management utilities.

### 11. State machine missing states ✅ Completed (design decision — see note below)

**Note:** The C version uses `EngineStopCause` as secondary metadata alongside `EngineState` instead of baking stop reasons into the state enum. This is a **better approach for C** — it avoids state explosion and separates "what is the engine doing?" from "why did it stop?".

### 12. Duration should be in milliseconds ✅ Completed

---

## Suggestions

### 1. Implement wall-clock timing with sub-second precision ✅ Completed

### 2. Implement content provider system ✅ Completed

### 3. Implement content chunking / formatters ✅ Completed

### 4. Implement SQLite persistence ✅ Completed

### 5. Implement type-safe callback/signal system ✅ Completed

Each event type owns an opaque `Signal` embedded in the `Engine` struct. Per-event registration functions (`engineOnStarted`, etc.) connect callbacks. Supports disconnect by slot index, clear per event, and 5 simultaneous slots per event type.

### 6. Implement exception/error hierarchy

Port the C++ version's exception hierarchy to C error codes:
- `ENGINE_ERROR_NONE` — No error
- `ENGINE_ERROR_CONFIG` — Configuration error (invalid mode, unknown option)
- `ENGINE_ERROR_STATE` — State machine error (invalid transition)
- `ENGINE_ERROR_PROVIDER` — Provider error (database query failure)
- `ENGINE_ERROR_CONTENT` — Content error (empty file, invalid format)
- `ENGINE_ERROR_FILE` — File I/O error (file not found, permission denied)

### 7. Implement logger ✅ Completed

### 8. Add auto-save functionality

Port the C++ version's `setAutoSave(bool)`:
- When enabled, automatically persist session data on completion/timeout
- Integrate with the Repository module

### 9. Implement test access macros

Port the C++ version's `TYPR_ENABLE_TEST_ACCESS` pattern:
- Conditionally expose internal state for testing
- `getContent()`, `getIndex()`, `getChunkCount()`, `getChunkIndex()`
- `setFormatter()` for testing different formatters

### 10. Add continuous integration

Set up GitHub Actions (or similar) to:
- Build on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Run the test suite on every push/PR
- Check code formatting with clang-format
- Run static analysis (cppcheck, clang-tidy)

### 11. Optimize memory usage

The `incorrectKeystrokesIndices` array allocates 4096 × `uint16_t` = 8 KB per session. Consider:
- Using a bitset instead of `uint16_t` values (4096 bits = 512 bytes)
- Making the buffer size configurable or dynamic
- Using a sparse representation for long texts

### 12. Create proper API documentation

Add comprehensive Doxygen-style documentation matching the C++ version:
- Document all public functions with `@param`, `@return`, `@see` tags
- Provide usage examples in header comments
- Generate HTML documentation as part of the build
